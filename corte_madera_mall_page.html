     <p>The Corte Madera Mall is split into two sides: Town Center + The Village. The Town Center side is the side that
        is <em>generally</em> used more as a place to hang out with friends, with food and seating areas, and The
        Village is more of the shopping side with less food. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Town Center</li>
